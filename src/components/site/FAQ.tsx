  {
    q: "Is Day 1 employment really guaranteed?",
    a: "Yes. Every admitted student receives a salaried role with a partner developer or PropTech firm activated on enrollment day. Your offer letter is signed before the first class begins.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the total program investment?",
    a: "₹4,80,000 for the 24-month cohort. This is materially offset by the salaried Day 1 employment income you earn from your assigned developer partner.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is this program for?",
    a: "Graduates, working professionals, and founders who want to build inside the Indian real estate stack — sales, asset management, PropTech product, or venture creation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the Lotlite Sandbox & Demo Day work?",
    a: "Through the 24 months you build a production-grade PropTech venture inside our Sandbox. Demo Day is a closed-room pitch to 50+ VCs and a ₹10 Cr allocation fund actively deploying into the category.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the program full-time? Where is it based?",
    a: "Full-time and experiential. Pune-headquartered with hybrid field immersion across partner offices. On-demand mobility fleet is included for client and site work.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the admissions timeline?",
    a: "Cohort 04 is open. Submit your application → diagnostic interview within 7 days → activation letter within 14 days of acceptance.",
